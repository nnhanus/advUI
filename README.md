# ScoopRecoup
ScoopRecoup is a desktop game to teach basic coding principles to children aged 8-12. It was developed to satisfy requirements for the Advanced Interactive Programming course as part of the HCI Masters program at Universite Paris-Saclay. The application is built using Java Swing and focusses on developing custom components and interactions.

## Install and Run
ScoopRecoup was built on Java 10. Download and Run Main.java to play on your own device.

## Game Mechanics
This game requires a mouse with a button. It is only offered in English.
There are 5 levels in ScoopRecoup and each level, except for the last, introduces a new concept. Users have access to blocks that are drag-and-dropped into a playing field to move a character on the screen with the goal of collecting icecream scoops. There are 4 blocks: Move, Turn, For, and If. These blocks are explained at the beginning of every level if Tutorial mode is set on. If not, the descriptions can be accessed from the helper on the main playing screen. Users must work through levels in order.
